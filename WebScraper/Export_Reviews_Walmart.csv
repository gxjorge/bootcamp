This refrigerator includes a light that is not described in the description.
The refrigerator area is also pretty spacious compared to other ones I
saw that are about $60-$80 dollars more. You can fit a bag of ice.

If you are looking for a mini refrigerator for your room, office or warehouse,
this is the way to go. I am extremely happy with it.

Thank you Walmart for having this on sale :)",2015-07-02T10:34:15,The Deal Of The Century :),240,38,

We tend to overload our motorhomes fridge and open to get things like sodas, beer, etc out often. This causes large variations in the internal temp. We decided a small fridge for drinks, etc. would help and this works great. This Igloo being larger than the small 1.7 cube ones holds much more. Has glass shelves so bottles don't easily fall over, at a 4 setting the temp stays steady at 35 degrees, is quiet.

For a measly $2.97 more, it offered Standard Shipping which said would be delivered on 2/19. After placing the order, it jumped up to 2/21 (no big deal, still within 5 business days).

12,15162430,"Igloo 4.5 cu. ft. Refrigerator and Freezer, Black, FR464",4,"I've had this for a couple months now.
So far, I really like it. It looks great.
We did site-to-store, and it wasn't banged up when we got ours.
It was very dirty on the inside though. I don't think it was use dirt, more like warehouse storage dirt, IMHO.

You can put a lot of drinks/food in this one.
Note that the photo WM is currently using for this item is NOT NOT NOT the actual inside of this fridge. The inside photos are mixed up between this model and the Haier 4.6 model! (I listed that model as a recommended link). I bought this one, because I wanted the freezer that went across the entire top. The Igloo model is only a HALF of a freezer. You can put a couple ice cube trays and some freezer pops, but that's about it. It is also a MANUAL defrost.

Be sure to let it sit unplugged for at least 4 hrs before using to let the oils and gases settle back into the right places. Also, we let ours run cold overnight BEFORE we put any food in to the box. You will want a good chill on the inside before adding room temp foods.

The dial goes from 1 to 7, and we've found we pretty much need it on the 7 to get drinks chilly.
The door storage is fantastic, and it easily holds a lot of things. The shelves are adjustable somewhat (not lots of options, but you can move the top one down). They are very nice shelves - very sturdy. Note that the bottom area does not have a slide out tray, and is only about half of the depth of the other shelves. What we did was make this our water bottle storage area, and they fit there just right. So, use that as a gauge - a 16.0 oz water bottle fits on its side just right on the very bottom.

The noise level is completely do-able. I was afraid it would be very loud, but it isn't. You do hear it kick on and off though, but it is right next to the bed and you don't have to turn up the tv to hear over it.

My only real complaint (other than the wrong photo of the insides, which is very misleading), is that this item is very much affected by the temperature of the room you have it in. In other words, if you use this in a basement, you'll definitely have really cold drinks/food. If it is in a hot garage - not nearly as much. We had a bad heat wave here a week ago, and it struggled to keep things cool inside, with a very noticeable dip in inside temperature.

Would I buy another one? Probably not, because I wanted the bigger freezer. But, I've spent the money now, and it does what I originally wanted - it allows me to keep some drinks and cold foods upstairs for when everyone else is gone (I am partially disabled, so can't run to the downstairs kitchen when I want something). All in all, very glad that I have it now. I think Igloo should have had this down a little better after all these years in the business of keeping food and drinks cold, but it wasn't horrible. It holds everything I need it to, even if not as cold as I'd really like it to be.",2011-06-14T17:03:49,"Works great, but depends on the room temperature",88,17,KatyKatIL
13,15162430,"Igloo 4.5 cu. ft. Refrigerator and Freezer, Black, FR464",5,"I was a bit weary when looking at this mini fridge, because of the fact that a lot of cheap fridges die after a few weeks... But this one has been wonderful. and I personally couldn't have found a more suitable fridge to contain my goodies. I bought it on 3/18 and it is still working just as great as the day I picked it up, the value is worth purchasing this product alone! I have to say though that the picture is a little mis-leading as the freezer in this model is actually smaller and more compact than the picture portrays (I can fit maybe a couple TV dinners in the freezer section at best). I have changed the set-up of my room & moved recently and can say that it seems very durable as the fridge was in the back of my F250 with not as much as a scratch on it. The appearance is very nice, however the only true complaint I have is the fact that you cannot fit anything in the door except a small thin bottle, butter box, etc...

I bought this mini fridge as present for a house warming party and let me tell you, it looked like I found this thing in an alley!

The box was all weathered and beaten up badly. I was worried that it would be damaged due to the box it came in. Since it was a gift, I couldn't open it and see.

Once the embarrassing box was opened, the was a dent on the door and two on the sides. The hinge for the door was bent the wrong way and the top of the door was completely scratched up. The little piece of plastic that was supposed to cover the metallic hinge was broken as well.

Then, as i went to plug it in, I noticed the white plastic cover that covers up some wiring was cracked and broken off as well.

I was so embarrassed when I gave this hunk of junk as a gift. I will never order anything from walmart and have it shipped ever again!

15,15162474,"Igloo 3.2 cu. ft. 2-Door Refrigerator and Freezer, Stainless Steel",4,"When I started college my mom bought an old refrigerator from a friend. It still works, but I purchased this one because too much ice was building up in it. When I got it, I didn't like that the appearance wasn't matted, but I dealt with it because I didn't want to send it back (it almost looks mirrored). So far, I think this refrigerator is decent. It gets really cold. I find myself using it on either 3 or 4. The description says that you can't store food in the freezer for extended periods of time (past a week), but I have and have had no problems with the quality of the food. The spaces between the shelves are smaller than they appear to be, so for the moment, I have taken the top shelf out to store milk and other larger items. The door shelf in the freezer it not really wide enough to hold a lot. I have seen some small amounts of ice in the top and bottom of it, but it may be because of the temperature it was set on at first. I had seen products like this in stores before, but they were either in the box or taped closed, so I complaints may just be because I had no real idea of what to expect from a two door compact refrigerator. Other than that, I think it is a pretty good product. Of course with anything stainless there are going to issues with fingerprints, but nothing major.

They had the product information, which confirmed that this unit requires a grounded 110/120V outlet, NOT 160V. Also this allowed for cabinets to be designed with the proper unit measurements. So Walmart should include the proper information AND provide a link or note referring to Curtis International, not Igloo, so that others do not have to wonder why they are buying an Igloo product that Igloo does not make or know about!",2011-12-20T12:18:00,Walmart Needs to Update Info,195,42,chriscamm
18,15162474,"Igloo 3.2 cu. ft. 2-Door Refrigerator and Freezer, Stainless Steel",5,"I've had many mini-fridges (school, dorm, home-office, office, garage#.. and so far this little 2-door, 3.2 cu ft. Igloo mini-fridge is the BEST. Oddly enough, it is also the least expensive #?!# of them all. It's sturdier, more attractive, quieter, smoother, more powerful and just BETTER than every other brand I've had.. no kidding. I've never had a quieter-running mini-fridge.

Example: This is replacing a 2-year-old Emerson 3.2 2-door compact fridge I had in my office-- the sides remained warm/hot-ish at all times, it stopped and started/ sputtered on a regular basis, the frozen items would thaw-out randomly, door seals weren't adequate and the doors were faux stainless steel.. #small dents appeared when barely touched# and it cost 3 X what this one did. I had a decent little Haier which was similar but much louder, cost about $75 more and faux stainless steel. A GE that wasn't bad but again, cost more, was louder and faux stainless steel.

Having the dedicated large freezer compartment in this compact 2-door fridge is ideal. Great for frozen entrees, ice cream bars, quick-chilling beverages, making ice, etc. Great for vitamins, beauty & health creams & lotions, perfect for indoor/ outdoor patios, guest rooms, offices and dorms. It holds quite a lot.

The main fridge-compartment is substantial and the adjustable shelving is a real help.

I'm really impressed that the doors are genuine stainless steel #other similar mini-fridges use an imitation, silvery-coloured surface that dings and dents to no end#. This is metal = strong and beautiful.

I bought wire shelving units to house office electronics and office ""mini-kitchen"" #allows for air circulation and keeps everything dust-free#. An amazing space-saver.. highly recommend!

Very pleased with the Igloo fridge.. so much so, I'm ordering a second one. Thrilled with the price and all-but-free shipping #something like $2.75 for FedEx ground.. you can't beat that#- received in a couple of days.

I bought the 2-year care-pack #Walmart.com care pack# which was under $20. Complete coverage #including damage from power surges, which is never covered by a manufacturer's warranty#. Loving this little Igloo.. you will too!",2014-01-02T15:05:37,Ticks all of the boxes !,143,25,DayTwo

20,15162473,Igloo 3.2 cu. ft. 2-Door Refrigerator and Freezer,5,"Hi. I read various mini-fridge reviews (including Consumer Reports), and chose the Igloo 3.2 because of price, convenience (I could pick it up at our local Walmart with free shipping), and customer reviews said it got COLD. Also, there didn't seem to be many ""broken, dented, or dead after two weeks"" reviews, which is a big plus for durability/reliability. It's a hassle having to return a 70-pound item for exchange, and I definitely didn't want to be bothered, so that's important!

I ordered it online on 8/3 (Friday night at 9pm) and it was ready to be picked up at our local Walmart on 8/10 (the next Friday), even though the delivery window was up to 8/16. That's FAST delivery for a heavy object. I strongly recommend picking it up personally at the store, where it comes from the Walmart warehouse standing upright (the Freon needs to settle to the bottom if you still have to tilt it to get it home. I had to put it on the side to fit my 4Runner SUV, but left it in the box upright overnight and it ran fine. Home delivery is by third parties, and a lot of damage seems to occur in the process, which is why I don't recommend it.

The Igloo 3.2 is very well designed, and holds a LOT of stuff. The separate freezer compartment is relatively large and efficient. Aside from minor fingerprints showing on the black exterior, which are easily wiped off, the white interior is easy to clean.

DETAILS AND OBSERVATIONS... TEMPERATURE: Internet research recommends 40 degrees food section, about 28 degrees freezer. I checked multiple times with a digital thermometer and my Dad's good old 50 year old mechanical thermometer. End result: I suggest putting the thermostat (there's only one) at 5 to 5.5, which gives the food section about 38-40 degrees (perfect). However, the first time I checked the freezer, I had to look twice in amazement. Zero degrees. That's Farenheit NOT CENTIGRADE. Water freezes at 32 degrees F. so we are talking SUB-ZERO. That's cold, which is very important if the power goes off. It will keep the whole fridge cold for a long time.

POWER CONSUMPTION: I have a very useful ""Kill-A-Watt"" power meter ($30) which I can plug anything into to see what the gadgets draw and what they cost. The ""Energy Guide"" says ""$22 estimated yearly operating cost."" Wrong. Here are the figures: after 335 hours continuous use, 75 watts/1.43 amps/170va (great for a mini-generator during a storm, plus it will stay cold a long time without power), .44pf, COST@$0.110kwh: 20 cents a day, $1.45/week, $6.25/month, $76.12/year.

OTHER USEFUL INFO: There is an ""ON-OFF"" switch next to the light on the thermostat. There is NO EXPLANATION anywhere that I can find for what it does. However, if you look at the circuit diagram on the back of the fridge, it appears to manually control a heating element which conceivably helps defrost the freezer. I really haven't seen much of a frost problem so far after 3 weeks, which says a lot for the door seals not letting moisture in. I suggest leaving the switch OFF unless you want to experiment. Frost only appears (so far) at the back of the food and freezer compartments. The compressor piping protrudes about an inch from the back, and the compressor gets HOT, so you will want to leave a few inches behind the fridge for clearance and ventilation. Finally, there appears to be an indentation at the back of the food compartment to catch melting ice water, which is plugged up. If it were open, the water would theoretically drain into a hot pan on top of the compressor and evaporate, but I don't know if the factory decided against it for electrical safety reasons.

Summary: great refrigerator so far. I strongly recommend the additional WalMart 3-Year extended warranty for $25, so if/when it breaks or the compressor burns out in a few years...NEW REFRIGERATOR !

24,15162473,Igloo 3.2 cu. ft. 2-Door Refrigerator and Freezer,5,"I purchased this fridge/freezer to replace a similar Haier model that failed after only one month. I almost replaced the Haier with a Black and Decker, but they are the same unit with different branding. This Igloo model is made by a different manufacturer*, so I am hoping for better quality. So far, it is much quieter and seems to be better quality. The door on the Igloo is not reversible, but I can deal with that. The freezer section is also smaller but it will still fit a nice stack of Hungryman dinners nicely. I don't think the description says it has a light, but it does. I have attached some pictures of the unit I received. Also, it doesn't look identical to the one for sale online (mine has an Igloo logo on it). So far, I am really liking this unit. If it craps out on me, I will be sure to update this review.

*One of the things I used to determine it was made by a different manufacturer was the Energy Guide. The Black and Decker and Haier had identical energy guides. The Igloo was much different with regard to energy use specifications. When I actually received the unit, I noticed the compressor is very different from the Haier.

However, it has glass shelves and those are unbroken and brand new.
They're taped in place and have a piece of foam on their edges to ensure they don't move.
The shelves are awesome. To take them out you need to tilt them forward slightly because they loosely lock in place on the back edge. Also, there are several shelve slots so you can easily adjust the shelves to accomodate your changing needs and foods that you're putting in there.
The interior size will accept a regular sized platter with food on it.
The door accepts a two litre bottle of Diet Coke (nectar of the gods). because the wire holder for it flaps down, I can insert the two litre bottle with one hand. Very convenient.
It is a TALL unit. I have a regular folding table next to it and the top of the refrigerator is at the same height as the table.
It would be an awesome, home office/college/small office refrigerator. I have mine about six feet from where I program in my home office. Completely quiet. Its great to have veggies in arms reach so I can ""munch"" on them instead of the convenient snacks that we all have sitting around our computers.

My only disappointment is a large dent/crease at the rear left corner of the fridge. The shipping box was in perfect shape, so it was obviously damaged before it went into the box.
Since it appears to be working fine and doing its job, and given its weight (about 70 lbs) and the distance I'd need to haul it to return it, then wait for another one, we've decided to put up with the dent and hope it has no negative effect on the functioning & lifespan of the fridge.

I had to call twice because the person that answered the phone hardly spoke english and didn't understand the question. Neither person could understand my simple question. (By the way, Igloo is not the maker of this unit and cannot answer any question. They suggest calling the number on the literature which is where all the non english understanding people work) So, since I couldn't get an answer to my simple question, I returned it to Walmart and bought a Black and Decker instead. It does have a temp control on it. It is possible that the Igloo I got was a defect, but since I couldn't get an answer on that, I decided that I didn't want to order a second one and find that it too had no temp control.",2013-11-04T07:37:45,Missing Feature,119,36,Bikebirder

So I got the idea for a compact chest freezer from Wal-Marts Black Friday flyer. They had a 7.0cu ft for a bargain price, but I didn't have the room or the need for something so big, So I found this cute little Igloo freezer on their web-site, also for a pretty great price. I live in a 1-bedroom apt. & this is a perfect size - 3.6cu ft. is plenty of room for when there are good sales on meat or other frozen foods. It has a removable basket, but I use it for bagged frozen veggies. And it has a raised ""shelf"" that I keep butter, cheese & boxed veggies on that. The deep (full depth) section is where I keep my meats. It's probably a good idea to tape a list to the lid of what you put in there & dated when in case stuff starts to get buried. (see my photo I included in my review) I actually have it sitting right inside my front door, so when I come home from grocery shopping with heavy bags, I can drop all the freezer stuff right there. So far it has been running just great, keeps everything nice & frozen. I haven't gotten an electric bill (yet) since I got it, so i'm not sure what the cost is going to be to run it, I can get back to you on that... The size is 22x22x33""high. It runs very quietly, tho you do hear it when it clicks on & off - that's normal. It plugs into a regular 3-prong, 120v outlet...no special outlet needed.
And VERY IMPORTANT...I read this in the manual on-line before I picked it up from the store, you need to know that when you get it home & set it up, you need to let it sit in the proper upright position for 24hrs. to give the cooling system a chance to settle BEFORE you plug it in & it turns on. Chances are it was not kept in an upright position in shipping to the store, and when they wheeled it out to me at the store, they had it laying on it's side, and I had to lay it on it's side to get it in my SUV for the ride home. But I just made sure to let it stand for 24hrs. in the upright position before I plugged it in. You can damage the cooling system if you don't do this and then you'll think it's a defective product & you'll be running back & forth to the store to return it & get a new one.... Anyway, this is something probably any body can use and it was very affordable.

We just received our electric bill and this freezer doesn't seem to have had any noticeable affect on it at all, so hurray for that!

At 69 lbs shipping weight, it's light weight enough for my husband to pick up and set back inside the trailer for the trip home. It only made a light layer of frost the whole weekend. The vacuum seal was awesome. There are wheels on the front, which helped in moving it around. I'm not sure the ground was perfectly level and it still worked like a champ. Absolutely no hesitation in recommending this.

For the next camping trip we will turn it on the day before to get it cold and load it up with the cold food for transport. After we arrive at the camp site, we'll move the refrigerated food to the refrigerator. We won't need to buy ice at all.

It IS quiet though! But one more warning... FedEx lays them down in their trucks for God only knows how far. And it says right on the carton: ""Do NOT lay down - Keep upright!"" So be sure to let it stand at least 24 hours before plugging it in to allow the refrigerant oil to hopefully run back into the compressor rather than in the Freon lines where it doesn't belong.",2013-12-21T00:24:36,Poor engineering,62,19,gimmeabreak4

126,40685156,"Galanz 3.1 cu ft Double-Door Refrigerator, Black",4,"I was careful in my selection of compact refrigerators...and for the price...well...I could not resist. I am grateful that I am VERY mechanically inclined - the refrigerator door did not close after I took the tape off. I unscrewed the bottom nut and was able to close the door, but I knew I should not have had to do that.
As it was, I needed to swap the door direction anyway, so I read the instructions. No detail there. It would have been nice to know that foam covered all holes that the plastic covers did not seat into, and that it was easy enough to clear the foam using a socket drive and the provided screw.
When I removed the bottom hinge, I saw the problem with the door and 'fixed' it (the metal plate had been bent out of shape and I bent it straight) - not the most encouraging thing to do to a refrigerator you have not even turned on yet - but the door closed and sealed beautifully! Absolutely no problems with the design.
I set the fridge in my designated spot and it is humming away (lightly) and keeps my food cold just like it is supposed to.
I figure the chances of someone else getting a refrigerator that does not close are slim. And if one of my friends bought one and it arrived that way - I am a step ahead and am armed with a solution.

The cubes do have hollow centers, which is probably why it can make them so fast but this thing pumps out ice. We don't empty the container into another one in the freezer or anything, we just take the ice directly from the machine as needed. If a full basket of ice sits in the unit, it will start to melt, but the ice melts into the water reservoir and just uses that to make more ice. We have four members in our house and haven't run out of ice yet.

Cons: only 1 basket, hand grooves on the sides of the lid instead of front, short cord, $30 more here than I paid at a competitor.
The most remarkable thing about this freezer is that it actually has a refrigerator setting in addition to the freezer setting, so it allows it to be used as more than just a freezer. With the low operating costs, this would make a great second frig for beverages and surplus groceries.
It isn't terribly heavy when it is empty, so it's easy to pickup at the store if you have a van or truck to transport it. You do need 2 people to lift it unless you are very strong!
I wish it came with at least 2 baskets, 3 would be even better. My solution to the lack of separation was to use a tall skinny box and flat cardboard vertically between stacks of food. Also the hand grooves being on the sides of the lid instead of the front take a little getting used to. This is a second freezer of this size for our family, replacing a large upright energy hog.

189,21024197,"Avanti 1.7 cu ft Refrigerator Superconductor, Stainless Steel",4,"I did a lot of research before buying this, as I wanted it to replace my ""faux"" refrigerator (which is actually an icebox) in my 1992 Bayliner Ciara Express 2452. Comparable dual power RV refrigerators go for 800 bucks!

Many of the reviews in other places said it would arrive damaged/dinged due to poor packaging and that the 12 volt DC input often would not work. Given Walmarts return policy, I decided to risk it for a site to store to minimize shipping damage with UPS and also because I thought I had a good chance of solving the 12V issue since I have mad technology skills.

Happy to say unit arrived in perfect condition. Packing must have been improved somewhat, though I can see how a puncture in the shipping box could result in a ding in the metal.

120 Volt AC wall power power test went without a hitch, unit worked great.

12 Volt test was dead on arrival, not even the internal light would go on, just as other reviews elsewhere have said.

So I decided to open it up and do some looking around. I noted that the 12volt input had +/- polarity reversal protection diodes on the control circuit board...and that made me wonder if maybe all that was wrong was that the wires from the rear 12V input socket to the circuit board were reversed.

That was easy to test, I simply reverse the leads on my test power supply that I had alligator clipped on and BINGO the fridge powered right up.

I simply cut the 12V supply wires (they had crimp wire nuts in the middle of the cable from rear panel to circuit board), reversed them, and used two butt crimp style connectors to rejoin the wires. A 5 minute fix.

Manufacturer probably has no final test for 12 volt DC input after assembly, but other upstream tests before the rear panel and wires are attached. This explains why so many 12 volt DC failures have been reported. If you have basic wiring skill and can use a screwdriver, you can fix this easily if yours doesn't work out of the box on 12V DC.

Now the fridge works perfect on my DC power in my boat, no issues. FYI power draw in max 3.5 AMPS DC, which tapers off after fridge gets to temperature. Power draw is lower than some comparable but higher priced RV fridges.",2013-03-10T12:24:08,"Great product, but 12V internal wiring is backward",35,0,meteorologistastronomer

We were able to get some of the denting out but the damage is still very noticable. Couldn't send it back because we were taking the solar cooler on a camping vacation with us in less than 3 days of it's arrival. Other than that we love the cooler. We are also truckers practically living over the road. Although we do have a built-in mini frigerator, we brought the solar cooler on board with us and now there's nothing we can not buy, store, cook and enjoy while traveling. We haven't purchased the solar panels yet, just using the regular current in which has not caused ANY power problems. We don't need to keep our semi truck running because we have an APU ( Auxillary Power Unit ). Truckers will know what this is and what it mean. Truckers...just to give you an idea of it's size and power usage... We have the Solar Cooler at the foot of the bottom bunk ( where we sleep!), my husband is 5'8 and he can still stretch completely out. The width of the cooler stretch to the width of the matress. As far as power usage...We run the built-in refrigerator, microwave, t.v., playstation unit, and cook in our skillet OR slow cooker without issues however we do need to turn the truck motor on while using the portable oven.

I feel like 5.5 cu ft of space is just the right amount for my household (we live in a tiny house). I did a lot of research on the internet prior to purchasing this appliance and decided to give it a try based on its energy rating (though i kept on finding two different energy draw info sheets for this Avanti 5.5). I ended up returning it when realizing that the temperature control for the fridge and freezer are on the same dial in the fridge- this was a deal breaker for me.
Also when we received the unit the top freezer coil was popped out of place. To put it back in it looked like we might have to take apart part of the freezer-not something I want to do with a new unit.

234,39082862,"Danby Designer 2.6 cu ft All Refrigerator, White",2,"I wanted a compact fridge without one of those useless little freezer compartments for my mother's room at the nursing home. After searching relentlessly for several months I have found that they are few and far between. I could not find a single one in any store, only online. Originally I purchased an Avanti because it ran by superconducter instead of a compressor, so I tried it for the lack of noise. According to the FDA food must be refrigerated at a MAXIMUM of 40 degrees to keep bacteria at bay. That fridge never went below 42 even at the highest setting. So I returned it. I bought this Danby as a replacement even though the user reviews were mixed, almost as many bad as there were good. But I took a chance because there just aren't that many choices without the useless little freezer. I originally tried it on the setting about 3/4 of the way around, but it did not go down to 40. Inching it up again it still did not go down to 40, so I have had to set it on the maximum setting. At the maximum it does fluctuate between 38 and 40 which is perfect. I will keep this because the only other choices are brands that I have never heard of and have a majority of bad reviews. I feel i'm stuck with this one, but I have no confidence in it. I don't think that a fridge should be ""just right"" at maximum. I feel that if it is at just the right temperature on the maximum setting when the thing is brand new, it can only go downhill from there. Once summer comes the temp is sure to rise as the room temperature rises and it can not be raised any more. I will have to just keep beverages in there but no food. Very disappointing. I would not really recommend.",2015-01-02T10:02:09,Not cold enough,6,1,JustMakingEndsMeet

239,37652122,Sunpentown 2.4-cu. ft. Compact Refrigerator,5,"I live completely off-grid and needed a smaller fridge than my big Maytag-which, even though quite efficient for it's size, still uses 3.8 amps. During winter I get the occasional ""low-voltage shutdown"" during cloudy weather that lasts for more than 2 days. This leaves me completely ""dead-in-the-water"", no phone, lights, computer or water pump. Since I have received my Sunpentown 2.4 cu. ft. fridge (hooked it up right after Thanksgiving) I've had no problems and my battery voltage is consistently higher. I find it has plenty of room for my needs, and I don't waste food like I used to in the big fridge. It looks great and frees up storage space underneath (I built a stand for it). It only uses .85 amps. I run my woodstove pretty strong and, with the shorter days, this little beast keeps everything nice and cold. As a matter of fact, I had to turn it down from ""Medium"" to one notch below to keep things from freezing in the fridge section.

243,11154516,"Avanti Superconductor 2.5 cu ft Refrigerator, Black",1,"We bought this fridge to keep our mother's favorite foods and drinks on hand in her room at the nursing home. We wanted one without a freezer compartment. Since we didn't need one it would just be taking up space, and those little freezer compartments always have 4 inches of ice around them and constantly need to be defrosted. This was one of very few choices out there without the freezer, and many reviews said how quiet it is, which was a big plus.
Food must be refrigerated at a MAXIMUM of 40 degrees. Over 40 degrees bacteria sets in. This fridge has settings of low, medium, and high. At the highest setting it has never cooled below 42 degrees. We have moved it all around the room, thinking maybe the sun is hitting it during the day, or whatever. But no matter where we put it the temp never dropped below 42 and sometimes was as high as 50. This is all on the maximum setting possible. Not acceptable. We will be returning it.
